            about: "Named for its heavy red clay soil and large stones, the organically and biodynamically Redstone estate vineyard is perfect for maturing late-ripening varietals like Merlot. This is a bold Merlot of exceptional con-centration. Beautifully rich and ripe, the nose is dominated by dark fleshy fruits — think black cherry and plum — as well as chocolate. Blackberry and blackcurrant show first on the palate followed by sa-voury notes of coffee, cedar and hints of smoke and spice from 18 months spent in French oak — 40% new.",
